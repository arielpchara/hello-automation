# Hello Automation

My domestic automation project, using cheap IoT devices hacking (not so) with Tasmota firmware and integrating with Siri using, an unlicensed library protocol.

This is a messy project I don't apply much time to organize, is just an experimental project.

So, if you want to discover more about this go to the following links:
